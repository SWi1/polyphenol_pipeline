# Polyphenol Estimation Pipeline

The polyphenol estimation pipeline takes either ASA24 Items Files or NHANES "Individual Foods" Recall Files. Based on the data type, STEP 1 will differ but STEPS 2 - 6 are the same. For simplicity, STEPS 2 - 6 in this tutorial show the output from the demo ASA24 data. The report for STEP 2 shows summary information about the number of unmapped foods, which will vary between datasets.

### Steps Specific to ASA24
1. STEP1_ASA24_FDD_Disaggregation.Rmd
    - For provided ASA24 data, WWEIA food codes are disaggregated to ingredients. A new ingredient amound is calculated based off percentages included in the [FDA's Food Dissagregation Database](https://pub-connect.foodsafetyrisk.org/fda-fdd/). Total nutrient intake is also calculated across recalls for later standardization of polyphenol intake. 
    
### Steps Specific to NHANES
1. STEP1_NHANES_FDD_Disaggregation.Rmd
    - For provided NHANES data, WWEIA food codes are disaggregated to ingredients. A new ingredient amound is calculated based off percentages included in the [FDA's Food Dissagregation Database](https://pub-connect.foodsafetyrisk.org/fda-fdd/). Total nutrient intake is also calculated across recalls for later standardization of polyphenol intake. 
    
### Steps used on both ASA24 and NHANES
2. STEP2_FDD_FooDB_Content_Mapping.Rmd
    - Connects each of your disaggregated ASA24 Foods to their equivalent food description in FooDB so that polyphenol intake can be estimated.  
    - **IMPORTANT**- Provides summary information about the number of foods in your data that did not map to FooDB.
3. STEP3a_Polyphenol_Summary_Total.Rmd
    - Calculates total polyphenol intake (mg, mg/1000kcal) for each recall as well as an overall subject summary.
4. STEP3b_Polyphenol_Summary_Class.Rmd
    - Calculates class polyphenol intake (mg, mg/1000kcal) for each recall as well as an overall subject summary.
5. STEP3c_Polyphenol_Summary_Compound.Rmd
    - Calculates compound polyphenol intake (mg, mg/1000kcal) for each recall as well as an overall subject summary.
6. STEP3d_Polyphenol_Summary_Food_Contributors.Rmd
    - Examines food contributors to total polyphenol intake.

## Outputs

### Mapping
Our mapping output files are large feature-rich datasets, which we have compressed.
- Recall_Disaggregated.csv.bz2
    - Food codes are shown with their underlying ingredients and newly calculated gram intakes
- Recall_Disaggregated_mapped.csv.bz2
    - Food codes are shown with their underlying ingredients and newly calculated gram intakes, and FooDB food name equivalent (no content)
- Recall_FooDB_polyphenol_content.csv.bz2
    - Food codes are shown with their underlying ingredients and newly calculated gram intakes, and FooDB food names and polyphenol content
