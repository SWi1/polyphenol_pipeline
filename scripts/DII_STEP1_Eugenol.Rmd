## Calculate Eugenol Intake
This script takes in your disaggregated dietary data and FooDB-linked descriptions to calculate eugenol intake per recall and subject.

### INPUTS

-   **Recall_Disaggregated_mapped.csv.bz2** - Disaggregated dietary data, mapped to FooDB foods, From Step 2 of the polyphenol estimation pipeline
-   **FooDB_Eugenol_Content_Final.csv** - Eugenol Content for foods in FooDB, Provided File

### OUTPUTS

-   **Recall_DII_eugenol_by_recall.csv**: Sum eugenol content for each participant recall

## SCRIPT

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Clears all objects from memory
rm(list = ls())
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "..") # project root relative to scripts/
```

Load packages 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load data
```{r}
# Load provided file paths
source("provided_files.R")

# Load Dietary data that has been disaggregated and connected to FooDB
input_mapped = vroom::vroom('outputs/Recall_Disaggregated_mapped.csv.bz2', 
                            show_col_types = FALSE)

# Eugenol Content in FooDB
# Note: Eugenol doesn't have retention factors from Phenol Explorer
eugenol = vroom::vroom(FooDB_eugenol, show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  select(-c(source_type, food_name:orig_source_name))
```


### Merge FooDB-matched Ingredient Codes to FooDB Eugenol Content File.

- Link between FooDB Polyphenol Content and code-matched data is *food_id*.

```{r}
input_mapped_content = input_mapped %>%
  # Bring in the Polyphenol Content
  dplyr::left_join(eugenol, by = 'food_id') %>%
  # Remove content that is NA
  filter(!is.na(orig_content_avg)) %>%
  # Calculate eugenol amount consumed in milligrams
  mutate(eugenol_mg = (orig_content_avg * 0.01) * FoodAmt_Ing_g) %>%
  # Sum eugenol content by subject and recall
  group_by(subject, RecallNo) %>%
  # Calculate EUGENOL summed per recall, and rename for dietaryindex function
  mutate(EUGENOL= sum(eugenol_mg)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(c(subject, RecallNo, EUGENOL)) %>%
  # Keep distinct entries
  distinct(subject, RecallNo, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

### Export Eugenol Intake File for DII Calculation
```{r EXPORT}
vroom::vroom_write(input_mapped_content, 'outputs/Recall_DII_eugenol_by_recall.csv', delim = ",")
```
